# AI-Novice
This repository is a collection of projects and code samples for beginners who are just starting to learn about artificial intelligence. As an AI novice and a pupil of School of AI, I created this repository to share my learning journey with others who are interested in AI. The code samples are written in Python and PyTorch.
